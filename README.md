# Brain-Tumor-Diagnosis

- The primary objective is to build a deep learning model that can successfully recognize and categorize images into either a Brain Tumor (tumorous) or a Not a Brain Tumor(non-tumorous).
- Using image segmentation technique to extract the tumor from a given image.
- Using HeatMap technique: This is helpful for debugging the decision process of a convnet,
particularly in the case of a classification mistake. It also allows us to locate specific objects in an image.
- Develop an application that can help doctors to access data and provide recommendation for patient.
The diagnosis result can be verified by human professors. In fact, this application cannot replace human resource in healthcare. It can assist human to make the right decision if the knowledge base
was built.
